The tidymodels framework is a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles.\nThis course will teach you core tidymodels packages and their uses: data splitting/resampling with rsample, model fitting with parsnip, measuring model performance with yardstick, and basic model optimization with tune. Time permitting, you’ll be introduced to pre-processing using the recipes package. You’ll learn tidymodels syntax as well as the process of predictive modeling for tabular data."
